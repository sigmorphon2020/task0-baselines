# Baselines

This repository contains baseline systems for  SIGMORPHON 2020 Task 0.


## Non-Neural Baseline
The first baseline is a non-neural system that has been used as a baseline in earlier shared tasks on morphological reinflection.
## Neural Baseline
The second baseline is hard monotonic attention [(Wu and Cotterell, 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06319) and the transformer [(Vaswani et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), both one model per language and one model per language family. The system can be found [here](https://github.com/shijie-wu/neural-transducer/tree/master/example/sigmorphon2020-shared-tasks)
